 <!-- Migrations and seeding -->
- Seeding : Add mock data to our DB
- Migrations : important from beginning as we use them to define our database schema -- the “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models.

- create table using npx knex migrate:make table_name and will generate a migration file for specified table where we'll define specific elements of the table we'll require
